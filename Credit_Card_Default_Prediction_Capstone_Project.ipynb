From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the [K-S chart](https://www.listendata.com/2019/07/KS-Statistics-Python.html) to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments\n"
